# 👋 Hi, I’m @deli-bee
![Screenshot_20240329_200628](https://github.com/deli-bee/deli-bee/assets/165420294/d00ecbbc-e305-4154-87da-90b68e5e4288)

🐝 Buzzing into the GitHub hive, I’m here to pollinate my profile with projects that thrive! A lover of nature and a worker as diligent as a bee, I'm just getting my wings wet in this digital sea. 🌱

🛠️ As I buzz around from branch to branch, building and learning, don't be surprised if you find a garden of code flourishing here. Talk to me in a few months, and you'll see a hive buzzing with activity, each repository a testament to hard work and the beauty of coding.

Stay tuned for the honey! 🍯
